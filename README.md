<h1>Automatically Copying Websites Contents</h1>

This project was made as a challenge in a company contest, to automatically copy and translate to hindi all pages from this particularly company. For that, I used the Selenium webdriver and pyautogui library. The generated pages includes the original HTML, CSS and Javascript files and links, having the same behaviour as the original website. It has one deep level of links (when click to a button, redirecting to another page).
